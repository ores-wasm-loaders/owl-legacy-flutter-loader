# owl-flutter-loader

The shared flutter-web adapter: a wrapper over flutter's supported `_flutter.loader` lifecycle plus embedded multi-view attach/detach, so one engine can back several views in a persistent shell.

Part of [`ores-wasm-loaders`](https://github.com/ores-wasm-loaders) — the org that owns the fleet's shared
web-loading layer for the 35+ marketing sites and their applications. Its sibling
[`ores-wasm-loaders-test`](https://github.com/ores-wasm-loaders-test) carries the external-facing test surface.

## What this org is for

Marketing sites are HTML-first and cheap. The applications behind them are not: a Flutter
web release or a Leptos/Dioxus island bundle costs a download, a compile and an
initialization before it is useful. This org shares the *loading and integration
infrastructure* across every product — one coordinator, one Flutter adapter, one Rust
adapter family, one manifest contract — so the expensive part is prepared while the visitor
is still reading, and so 80–90% of that plumbing is written once rather than 35 times.

It deliberately does **not** claim to share application bytes, application memory, or a
running runtime across a normal navigation. See `owl-docs/docs/architecture.md`.

## Conventions for this repository

- Never execute the default `flutter_bootstrap.js` to 'warm the loader': it starts the application. Preparation is fetch-only; `initializeEngine`/`runApp` belong to activation.
- Renderer and JS-fallback selection stay with Flutter's own machinery; this adapter must not eagerly download every renderer variant.
- Multi-view means several views of ONE running application; it is not a way to host independently compiled Flutter apps in one engine.

## Tests

```sh
node --test test/*.test.mjs
```

No third-party dependencies: the whole org builds and tests offline, because it has to run
in every product org's CI before anything else is installed.
